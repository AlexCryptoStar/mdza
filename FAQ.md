# [What is Coinfy?](#what)
Coinfy is a web browser mobile/web app that allows you to manage all your crypto-wallets and crypto-assets at once, with a friendly and intuitive UI.



# [Our vision](#vision)
We believe in a decentralized future where everybody will use cryptocurrencies with decentralized apps. Our idea with coinfy is to offer you the best decentralized wallet to manage all your assets. 

We will never store any of your data. Coinfy does not use any database, is all browser based. 

We don't have login or we will never ask you for an email.
Coinfy doesn't know anything about you. The only data we will know is via Google Analytics to track the behavior of the users that make us the ability to improve the app.



# [Is it secure?](#secure)
Yes, it is. We will never store any private key, we always manipulate your private keys in the browser. And that private keys are always encrypted even in the browser. 

Even if your computer is compromised your private key can't be accessed because they are encrypted and we only allocate them temporarily in browser-memory.

Any time you need to send any coin you will need to type your password to decrypt the private key. This might be tedious at the beginning but we took that decision because the security is more important than any other thing.

Other wallets use the same password for all of your assets. We give you the possibility of setting a different password for each asset. We recommend you to use different passwords.



# [Why use Coinfy rather than others?](#why)
Well, we don't want to lie you because we know that there are no silver bullets when you are using a crypto-wallet. Each of them has pros and cons, it depends on your need.

### Why Coinfy over a desktop wallet such a Exodus, Electrum or Jaxx?
Basically, with Coinfy you only need a modern browser. No downloads, no updates. And you have instant access to mobile and web.

### Why Coinfy over another browser wallets such a blockchain.info, MyEtherWallet or bitaddress.org?
The first one asks you for an email, and they store your private key for you. And for MyEtherWallet or bitaddress are very similar to Coinfy in terms that they are browser-based and they don't store any of your data. The problem is that they only support Ethereum and Bitcoin respectively, and we want to support as many as we could.

### Why Coinfy over a hardware wallet such a Trezor or Ledger nano?
The main reason is basically that Coinfy is free.

### But hardware wallets are much more secure right?
No exactly. If you loose your gadget you can always restore your wallets using your 12/15 words seed. But you have had to write down those words. Coinfy works the same way, you must print paper-wallets or write down your 12 words anytime you create a new asset.


# [Does it have Coinfy any trade-off?](#tradeoffs)
Yes, of course. As we don't store any of your data is your responsibility to keep safe your paper wallets or your 12 words seed. Because if you lose them we are not able to restore your assets.

But we are working on a UI that forces you to save your data properly because is our big concern in this project.


# [Who you are and why are you doing Coinfy?](#whoweare)
We are a small company that believes in a future with cryptocurrencies and we are experimenting and trying to fit in this emerging world.

At some point, we will implement and exchanger build inside of Coinfy, and that's how we think we will make money.
